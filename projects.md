# Project work

[Slides](slides/Projects.pdf){ .md-button }

Approximately 1/3 of the course time is dedicated to doing project work. The projects will serve as the basis of your
exam. In the project, you will essentially re-apply everything that you learn throughout the course to a self chosen
project. The overall goals with the project is:

* To formulate a project within the provided guidelines
* Apply the material though in the course to the problem
* Present your findings

In the projects you are free to work on whatever problem that you want. That said, we have a specific requirement, that
you need to incorporate some third-party framework into your project. If you want inspiration for projects, here are
some examples

1. [Classification of tweets](https://github.com/nielstiben/MLOPS-Project)

2. [Translating from English to German](https://github.com/MikkelGodsk/dtu_mlops_exam_project)

3. [Classification of scientific](https://github.com/eyhl/group5-pyg-dtu-mlops)

4. [Classification of rice types from images](https://github.com/Snirpurin/MLOPS_group3)

## Open-source tools

We strive to keep the tools thought in this course as open-source as possible. The great thing about the open-source
community is that whatever problem you are working on, there is probably some package out there that can get you
at least 10% of the way. For the project, we want to enforce this point and you are required to include some third-party
package, that is neither Pytorch or one of the tools already covered in the course, into your project.

If you have no idea what framework to include, the [Pytorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) is a great place
for finding open-source frameworks that can help you accelerate your own projects where Pytorch is the backengine. All
tools in the ecosystem should work greatly together with Pytorch. However, it is important to note that the ecosystem is
not a complete list of all the awesome packages that exist to extend the functionality of Pytorch. If you are still
missing inspiration for frameworks to use, we highly recommend these three that has been used in previous years of the
course:

* [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models). PyTorch Image Models (also known as TIMM)
  is the absolutely most used computer vision package (maybe except for `torchvision`). It contains models, scripts and
  pre trained for a lot of state-of-the-art image models within computer vision.

* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). The Transformers repository from the Huggingface group
  focuses on state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP). It provides many pre-trained model to perform tasks on
  texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation,
  etc in 100+ languages. Its aim is to make cutting-edge NLP easier to use for everyone.

* [Pytorch-Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric). PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is a geometric deep
  learning. It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, also known as
  geometric deep learning, from a variety of published papers.

## Project days

Each project day is fully dedicated to project work, except for maybe external inspirational lectures in the morning.
The group decides exactly where they want to work on the project, how they want to work on the project, how do
distribute the workload etc. We actually encourage strongly to parallelize work during the project, because there are a
lot of tasks to do, but it it is important that all group members at least have some understanding of the hole project.

Remember that the focus of the project work is not to demonstrate that you can work with the biggest and baddest deep
learning model, but instead that you show that you can incorporate the tools that are taught throughout the course in a
meaningful way.

Also note that the project is not expected to be very large in scope. It may simply be that you want to train X model
on Y data. You will approximately be given 4 full days to work on the project. It is better that you start out with a
smaller project and then add complexity along the way if you have time.

### Day 1

The first project days is all about getting started on the projects and formulating exactly what you want to work on
as a group.

1. Start by brainstorm projects! Try to figure out exactly what you want to work with and begin to investigate what
    what third party package that can support the project.

2. When you have come up with an idea, write a project description. The description is the delivery for today and should
    be at least 300 words. Try to answer the following questions in the description:

    * Overall goal of the project
    * What framework are you going to use and you do you intend to include the framework into your project?
    * What data are you going to run on (initially, may change)
    * What models do you expect to use

3. (Optional) If you want to think more about the product design of your project, feel free to fill out the
    [ML canvas](https://madewithml.com/static/templates/ml-canvas.pdf) (or part of it). You can read more about the
    different fields on canvas [here](https://madewithml.com/courses/mlops/product-design/).

4. After having done the product description, you can start on the actual coding of the project. In the next section,
    a to-do list is attached that summaries what we are doing in the course. You are NOT expected to fulfill all bullet
    points from week 1 today.

The project description will serve as an guideline for us at the exam that you have somewhat reached the goals that you
set out to do. By the end of the day, you should commit your project description to the `README.md` file belonging
to your project repository. If you filled out the ML canvas, feel free to include that as part of the `README.md` file.
Also remember to commit whatwever you have done on the project until now. When you have done this, go to DTU Learn and
hand-in (as a group) the *link to your github repository* as an assignment.

We will briefly (before next Monday) look over your github repository and project description to check that everything
is fine. If we have any questions/concerns we will contact you.

### Day 2

The goal for today is simply to continue working on your project. Start with bullet points in the checklist from week 1
and continue with bullet points for week 2.

### Day 3

Continue working on your project, today you should hopefully focus on the bullet points in the checklist from week 2.
There is no delivery for this week, but make sure that you have committed all your progress at the end of the day. We
will again briefly look over the repositories and will reach out to your group if we are worried about the progression
of your project.

### Day 4

We have now entered the final week of the course and the second last project day. You are most likely continuing with
bullet points from week 2, but should hopefully begin to look at the bullet points from week 3 today. These are in
general much more complex, so we recommend looking at them until you have completed most from week 2. We also recommend
that you being to fill our [report template](reports/README.md).

### Day 5

Today you are finishing your project. We recommend that you start by creating a architechtual overview of your project
similar to this [figure](reports/figures/overview.png). I recommend using [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) for
creating this kind of diagram, but feel free to use any tool you like. Else you should just continue working on your
project, checking of as many bullet points as possible. Finally, you should also prepare yourself for the exam
tomorrow.

## Project checklist

Please note that all the lists are *exhaustive* meaning that I do not expect you to have completed very
point on the checklist for the exam.

### Week 1

* [ ] Create a git repository
* [ ] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
* [ ] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages
* [ ] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
* [ ] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
* [ ] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
* [ ] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
* [ ] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project
* [ ] Do a bit of code typing and remember to document essential parts of your code

* [ ] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments
* [ ] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
* [ ] When you have something that works somewhat, remember at some point to to some profiling and see if
      you can optimize your code
* [ ] Use Weights & Biases to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code. Additionally,
      consider running a hyperparameter optimization sweep.

* [ ] Create a trigger workflow for automatically building your docker images
* [ ] Get your model training in GCP using either the Engine or Vertex AI
* [ ] Create a FastAPI application that can do inference using your model
* [ ] If applicable, consider deploying the model locally using torchserve
* [ ] Deploy your model in GCP using either Functions or Run as the backend

### Week 3

* [ ] Check how robust your model is towards data drifting
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the system telemetry of your deployed model
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the performance of your deployed model
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed data loading
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed model training
* [ ] Play around with quantization, compilation and pruning for you trained models to increase inference speed

### Additional

* [ ] Revisit your initial project description. Did the project turn out as you wanted?
* [ ] Make sure all group members have a understanding about all parts of the project
* [ ] Uploaded all your code to github

## Exam

The exam consist of a written and oral element, and both contributes to the overall evaluation if you should pass or
not pass the course.

For the written part of the exam we provide an template folder called
[reports](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/dtu_mlops/tree/main/reports). As the first task you should copy the folder and
all its content to your project repository. Then, you jobs is to fill out the `README.md` file which contains the report
template. The file itself contains instructions on how to fill it out and instructions on using the included `report.py`
file. You will hand-in the template by simple including it in your project repository. By midnight on the 20/1 we will
scrape it automatically, and changes after this point are therefore not registered.

For the oral part of the exam you will be given a time slot where you have to show up for 5-7 min and give a very short
demo of your project. What we are interested in seeing is essentially a live demo of your deployed application/project.
We will possibly also ask questions regarding the overall curriculum of the course. Importantly, you should have your
deployed application, the github repository with your project code, W&B account and your GCP account ready before
you enter the exam so we can quickly jump around. We will send out an the time slots during the last week.
