### ‚ùî Exercises

1. Start by installing `prefect`:

    ```bash
    pip install prefect
    ```

2. Start a local Prefect server instance in your virtual environment.

    ```bash
    prefect server start
    ```

3. The great thing about Prefect is that the orchestration tasks and flows are written in pure Python.
